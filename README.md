## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

**Prerequisites**

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
- **Docker**: Docker is required for script sandboxing.
- **MongoDB**: A running MongoDB instance.

**ENV Variables**

1. Copy the `.env-example` file to `.env` in the following directories:

- `client`
- `server`

2. Update the values in the `.env` files to match your environment.

**Development Setup**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cronos.git
   cd cronos
   ```

**Steps**

Update BRANCH="dev" in the `development.sh` script to the desired branch.

Ensure the scripts are executable:

```bash
chmod +x development.sh
```

Run the development setup script:

```bash
./development.sh
```

This will:

- Pull the latest code.
- Install dependencies for the client and server.
- Build the `script-runner` Docker image.
- Start the server and client in development mode.

## Deployment üåê

**Prerequisites**

- Ensure the production environment meets the prerequisites listed above.

**Steps**

Update `BRANCH="main"` in the `deployment.sh` script to the desired branch.

Ensure the scripts are executable:

```bash
chmod +x deployment.sh
```

Run the deployment setup script:

```bash
./deployment.sh
```

This will:

- Pull the latest code from the main branch.
- Install and build the client and server.
- Restart/Run services using pm2.
